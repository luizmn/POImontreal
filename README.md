#README
This is a simple map guide to the top 10 places to visit in Montreal.

###Requirements
The tools used to develop this guide were:  
* Knockout  
* Google Maps API  
* Bootstrap 3  
* Javascript  
* HTML5 


But in order to make it work, you must have a Google Maps API Key.
If you do not have one, follow this guide to obtain yours.
If you do have the key, just download or clone the project via Github, put it in your desired folder.
Edit the file **"index.html"** and look for the expression **`YOUR_API_KEY`**. Change it with your key, save and close the file.
Then double click the file and the guide will open in your default browser.

**Note:** An active internet connection is required to use the guide since it will open a Google Map.
